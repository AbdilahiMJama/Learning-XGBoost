# Learning XGBoost Tutorial.
## Disclaimer:
### This is not my own work but rather from StatQuest aka Josh Starmer on Youtube. I do not own the data either, it is from Kaggle.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrJP9FLV3FE&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer) is the link to the video

This project was built along with the Youtube video on XGBoost in Python from start to finish.
It covers the following with minor changes:
* Loaded the Data From a File
* Identified and dealt with missing data
* Formatted data for XGBoost using one hot encoding
* Built an XGBoost Model for classification
* Optimize the XGBoost Parameter for Cross Validation and Grid Search()
* Built, Drew, Interpeted and Optimized teh XGBoost model.

#### Please Note that
* plot_confusion_matrix() was deprecated and updated to ConfusionMatrixDisplay().
* Make sure you install graphviz before you run it.
